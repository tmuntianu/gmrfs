# GMRFs + GPs

`data/` contains some of the data used, most notably `gmrf1.mat` which is a sample
from a GMRF

`notebooks/` contains all the notebooks, both for the Gaussian process and Gauss
Markov random field adventures. The GP notebooks are in a much more readable state
because they were made during the term when little time pressure due to finals
existed.

`report/` contains all of the LaTeX and images used to generate `report.pdf`

I'll clean up the GMRF notebooks soon, sorry it's such a mess right now.
